    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p>Hey, welcome to the greatest blog ever, I will be your host today. Feel free to call me Kyle or use my military callsign “hitman.” At the moment, 
      I am contracted out and working for a Fortune 500 company, CACI inc. My daily activities can be hectic at times, but I generally try and frame them 
      around hanging out with other people or self-development. Essentially, I would like to be called “guru” at something one day; you could say its my life’s purpose.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Anyways, spring is near, thus I’m gearing up for turf shredding and wolfing down coffee. Basically, my short-term goal is to swell up as the “cool uncle.” 
      Maybe one day it will transition to the “embarrassing dad,” but for now I’m stoked just to be an uncle. Apart from ripping glassy roads, I am probably addicted to 
      caffeine at this point. Without blowing it out of proportion, I would probably direct inject coffee if that was an option. Anyways, yeah that’s me, thanks for taking 
      the time to visit the biggest blog bomb on the internet!</p>

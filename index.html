    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <pre class="tab"><p>   Hey, welcome to the <u>GREATEST</u> blog ever, I will be your host today. Feel free to call me Kyle or use my military callsign “HITMAN.” At the moment, I am contracted
      out and working for a Fortune 500 company, CACI inc. My daily activities can be hectic at times, but I generally try and frame them around hanging out with 
      people or self-development. Essentially, I would like to be called “guru” at something one day; you could say its my life’s purpose. <br />
         Anyways, spring is near, thus I’m gearing up for turf shredding and wolfing down coffee. Basically, my short-term goal is to swell up as the “cool uncle.” Maybe one day it will 
            transition to the “embarrassing dad,” but for now I’m stoked just to be an uncle. Apart from ripping glassy roads, I am probably addicted to caffeine at this point. Without 
            blowing it out of proportion, I would probably direct inject coffee if that was an option. Anyways, yeah that’s me, thanks for taking the time to visit the biggest blog bomb 
            on the internet!</p></pre>
